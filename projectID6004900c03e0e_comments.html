<HTML><BODY><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Elliot_Griffis">William Elliot Griffis</a> was an American orientalist, Congregational minister, lecturer, and prolific author. He lived in Japan and traveled to Korea (at that time under Japanese occupation). This collection of fairy tales he published in 1922, in a series of similar books for various countries (which I plan to run through PGDP in the near future).

<p>The book itself is fairly easy, so have fun!
